# Client Libraries

OpenCGA implements four client libraries:

* [Java](java.md)
* [Python](python.md)
* [R](r.md)
* [JavaScript](javascript.md)

The source code of all these client libraries is autogenerated by OpenCGA, this ensures all the four clients are functionally equivalent and 100% of REST API.
