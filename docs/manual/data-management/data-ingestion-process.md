# Data Ingestion Process

## **Introduction**

The first stage in discovery and analysis of variants using OpenCGA is to load the source data, typically VCF files, into the system.

The data load process is divided into 5 steps: 

1. Register files into OpenCGA Catalog metadata file register
2. Index Variant Data- including transform and load
3. Annotate the new-indexed Variants \(Variant Annotation\) - as part of the database enrichment
4. Calculate the Statistics - as part of the database enrichment
5. Build/Update the Secondary Index

## **Prerequisites**

This document assumes the following:

* A workstation with network access to the web services on an OpenCGA server; this document assumes version 2.0 or later.
* OpenCGA client software installed on the workstation. Find [here]() the instructions on how to build OpenCGA from source.
* OpenCGA credentials with appropriate permissions. The owner user is the owner of the data; it’s the user who creates the project/study where the new data will be loaded. The users with permission to perform data ingestion into a concrete study in OpenCGA are the owner user, and other users with admin privileges for the specific study \(provided by the owner\).
* Sample Genomic \(e.g. VCF\) data and associated sample and phenotypic metadata

## **Project and Study organisation**

The project/study organisation is a key in order to optimise the data usability.

Projects provide physical separation of data into different database tables.  
Studies provide logical separation of data within a Project.

* You MUST store your data in different  projects when they are on different genome assemblies \(e.g you should create a project for data from GRCh37 and other for data from GRCh38\)
* You CAN store your data in different projects when there is no foreseeable  need to process them jointly.
* You may divide your data in studies corresponding to different independent datasets that may be used together in some analysis, with the aim of having homogeneous datasets for each study.

After deciding structure, the new projects and studies may need to be created. This step must be performed by the owner of the new created elements. 

#### **Creating new projects**

Once logged in to OpenCGA as the owner, a Project can be created with this command:

```text
$ ./opencga.sh projects create --id <short-project-id> 
                                -n <full-project-name> 
                                --organism-scientific-name hsapiens 
                                --organism-assembly <GRCh37|GRCh38>
```

Optionally, you can add other parameters like `--description` . You can get the full list of parameters by adding  to the command.

#### **Creating new studies**

Similar to the project creation, studies are created with this command:

```text
$ ./opencga.sh studies create --project <project-id> 
                              --id <short-study-id> 
                              -n <full-study-name>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You don’t need to provide the organism assembly again, as it’s inherited from the project. Remember that all studies from the same project will share the same assembly.
{% endhint %}

To get the list of all projects and studies belonging to one specific user, run:

```text
$ ./opencga.sh users info
```

### **Catalog file register**

This step presents the data to OpenCGA and registers the new files into the system. Samples will be created automatically after linking the file, by reading the VCF Header. This step can be further extended with extra annotations, defining individuals, creating cohorts or even families.

It is important to note that this step is a synchronous operation that does not upload the genomic data \(e.g:VCFs\)  into OpenCGA, instead, the files will only be “linked” \(registered\) with OpenCGA. Therefore, the files to link must be in a location that is accessible  by the OpenCGA server \(REST servers and the Master service\).

#### **Catalog Path Structure**

**I**nternally, the Catalog metadata holds a logical tree view of the linked files that can easily be explored or listed. Try using:

```text
$ ./opencga.sh files tree --study <study> --folder <folder>
```

New folders can be created with this command:

```text
$ ./opencga files create --study <study> --path <catalog-logical-path>
```

Being `<catalog-logical-path>` the directory that you’d like to create within catalog.

#### **Linking files synchronously \(less than 5000 samples\)**

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that for files with more than 5000 samples, the linking step needs to be performed as an asynchronous job using the command described below.
{% endhint %}

Each file needs to be “linked” into OpenCGA using this command line:

```text
$ ./opencga.sh files link --study <study> 
                           --path <catalog-logical-path> 
                           --input </path/to/data>
```

Multiple files can be linked using the same command typing multiple input files separated by space or comma.

#### **Linking files asynchronously \(more than 5000 samples\)**

For VCFs containing more than 5000 samples, the linking steps needs to be performed as an asynchronous job. In this case, a different command needs to be run:

```text
$ ./opencga.sh files link-run --study <study> 
                              --path <catalog-logical-path> 
                              --input </path/to/data>
```

**Full example:**

```text
## Create one folder “data/” in study “myStudy”
$ ./opencga.sh files create --study <owner@project:myStudy> --path <data> 

## Link the files “myFirstFile.vcf.gz” and “mySecondFile.vcf.gz” in the newly created folder
$ ./opencga.sh files link  --study <owner@project:myStudy> 
                           --path <data/> 
                           -i /data/myFirstFile.vcf.gz /data/mySecondFile.vcf.gz
```

### **Variant storage index**

This operation will read the content of the file, run some simple validations to detect possible errors or data corruptions, and ingest the variants into the Hadoop system, building some high performance indexes.

Each file index operation will be run by an asynchronous job, to be executed by the OpenCGA Master service. 

Contrary to the Catalog File Register step, only one file should be provided as input in the Variant storage index command line. This will create separate asynchronous indexing jobs for each one of the files. This is important in order to avoid failure of the jobs.

Use this command to launch a variant index job:

```text
$ ./opencga.sh variant index-run --study <study>
                                 --file <catalog-logical-path>
```

All the jobs along with their current status can be  either inspected  from IVA, or running this command line:

```text
$ ./opencga.sh jobs top ---study <study>
```

**Special scenarios**

* **Samples data split by chromosome or region**

By default, OpenCGA doesn’t allow you to index a VCF file if any of its samples is already indexed as part of another VCF file. This restriction is to avoid accidental data duplications. In case of having one dataset split by chromosome or region, this restriction can be bypassed by adding the param `--load-split-data <chromosome|region>` to the variant index command line. 

* **Multiple files for the same samples**

Similarly to the previous scenario, a dataset may contain multiple files from the same set of samples that may want to be indexed together, for example, when using multiple VCF callers for the same sample. In this case, you can bypass the restriction by adding the param  `--load-multi-file-data.`

* **Family or Somatic callers**

When using special callers it is important to specify it in the command line with either`--family / --somatic.`

{% hint style="danger" %}
Note: Be aware that the misuse of this parameters may lead to data corruption.
{% endhint %}

### **Variant Annotation**

Once all the data is loaded, we need to run the Variant Annotation. This is a key  enrichment operation that will attach CellBase Variant Annotations with the loaded data, allowing filtering by a large number of fields.

Find more information at**:**  [**http://docs.opencb.org/display/cellbase/Variant+Annotation**](http://docs.opencb.org/display/cellbase/Variant+Annotation)

The Variant Storage Engine will run the annotation just for the new variants, being able to reuse the existing annotations to save time and disk usage. This operation is executed at the project level, so shared variants between studies won’t need to be annotated twice.

```text
$ ./opencga.sh operations variant-annotation-index --project<project> 
                                                   --study <study>
```

Similar to the variant-index process, this command line will queue an asynchronous job to be executed by the OpenCGA Master service.

### **Variant Statistics calculation**

The second enrichment operation is the Variant Statistics Calculation. After defining a cohort, you might decide to compute the Variant Stats for that cohort. These statistics include the most typical values like allele and genotype frequencies, MAF, QUAL average, FILTER count...

```text
$ ./opencga.sh variant stats-run --study <study> 
                                 --index --cohort <coh1>,..,<cohN>
```

For updating the stats of all the cohorts, or when there are no cohorts in the study apart from the default `ALL cohort`:

```text
$ ./opencga.sh variant stats-run --study <study> --index --cohort ALL
```

**Special scenario:** when loading new files split by chromosome/region to a study that already contains data the annotation step can be performed as usual. However, when calculating the variant stats you need to add the param --update-stats. E.g:

```text
$ ./opencga.sh variant stats-run --study <study> 
                                 --index --cohort <ALL> 
                                 --update-stats
```

#### **Aggregated VCFs** 

{% hint style="danger" %}
**This section is a draft.**
{% endhint %}

In case of having computed stats codified in the INFO column of a VCF using standard or non-standard keys, these values can be converted into `VariantStats` models, and be used for filtering.

To extract the statistics, you need to create a mapping file between the INFO keys containing the information, and it’s meaning. Each line will have this format:  
**&lt;COHORT&gt;.&lt;KNOWN\_KEY&gt;=&lt;INFO\_KEY&gt;**

Then, this file needs to be linked in catalog, and referred when computing the stats.

OpenCGA supports 3 different “ways” of codifying the information, known as “aggregation method”. Some of these are named after public studies that started using them. Each one defines a set of known keys that will be used to parse the statistics.

* **BASIC : Using standard vcf-spec INFO keys.**
  * **AN : Total number of alleles in called genotypes**
  * **AC : Total number of alternate alleles in called genotypes**
  * **AF : Allele Frequency, for each ALT allele, in the same order as listed**
* **EXAC**
  * **HET: Count of HET genotypes. For multi allelic variants, the genotype order is 0/1, 0/2, 0/3, 0/4... 1/2, 1/3, 1/4... 2/3, 2/4... 3/4...**
  * **HOM : Count of HOM genotypes. For multi allelic variants, the genotype order is 1/1, 2/2, …**
* **EVS**
  * **GTS: List of Genotypes**
  * **GTC: Genotypes count, ordered according to “GTS”**
  * **GROUPS\_ORDER: Order of cohorts for key “MAF”**
  * **MAF: Minor allele frequency value for each cohort, ordered according to “GROUPS\_ORDER”**

                                 --aggregation-mapping-file custom_mapping.properties
```

### **Variant Secondary Index Build**

Secondary indexes are built using the search engine Apache Solr for improving the performance of some queries and aggregations, allowing full text search and faceted queries to the Variant database.

This secondary index will include the Variant Annotation and all computed Variant Stats. Therefore, this step needs to be executed only once all annotations and statistics are finished.

```text
$ ./opencga.sh operations variant-secondary-index --project <project> 
                                                  --study <study>
```

## **Enrichment Operations**

This steps are optional operations, that can be indexed to enrich the data displayed at the IVA web application:

### **Sample Variant Stats**

Sample Variant Stats will contain a set of aggregated statistics values for each sample. 

```text
$ ./opencga.sh variant sample-stats-run --study <STUDY> --sample all
```

These aggregated values can be computed across all variants from each sample, or using a subset of variants using a variant filter query. e.g:

```text
$ ./opencga.sh variant sample-stats-run --study <STUDY>
                                        --sample all
                                        --variant-query ct=missense_variant
                                        --variant-query biotype=protein_coding
```

By default, this analysis will produce a file, and optionally, the result can be indexed in the catalog metadata store, given an ID. 

```text
./opencga.sh variant sample-stats-run --study <STUDY>
                                      --sample all
                                      --index
                                      --index-id missense_variants
                                      --variant-query ct=missense_variant
                                      --variant-query biotype=protein_coding
```

The ID ALL can only be used if without any variant query filter.

```text
$ ./opencga.sh variant sample-stats-run --study <STUDY>
                                        --sample all
                                        --index
                                        --index-id ALL
```
