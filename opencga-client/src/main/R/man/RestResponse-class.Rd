\description{
This is an internal S4 class which defines the RestResponse object
}
\details{
REST web services return the response wrapped in a RestResponse 
object. This consists of some metadata and a list of _OpenCGAResult_ objects 
called _responses_ containing the data results and metadata requested. 
The *first response of the list* will always contain the response of the 
OpenCGA federation being directly queried. Any additional response in the 
list will belong to other federated servers that could be connected. Each 
federated response will contain a list of results ( _OpenCGAResult_ ) 
containing the data that has been queried.

\item{\code{params}}{list containing the specified parameters}

\item{\code{responses}}{list containing the results from the query. There is one list
